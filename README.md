# Blackbox
Store your social life on your personal, private blockchain

## What is Blackbox?
With the increase of privacy concerns nowadays and multiple data leaks from Facebook and other social medias,
I decided to create this little project called Blackbox. 

Blackbox is storing all your social media data, first from Twitter but in the long term from every social media
into a personal, private blockchain. That way, everything is recorded and nothing can be modified or alternated.
Just like the Bitcoin protocol, Blackbox put Tweets, Facebook statuses, Instagram pictures and so on
into blocks. 

## Installing
Run
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration
You'll need to get API access for Twitter and Instagram.
